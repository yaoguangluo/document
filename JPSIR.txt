JPSir was my teacher, every time I thought of him. My eyes such as the lake.

The first story
I still remembered a class where JPSir let us do the assembly language for deletion.
He said we can't use 8086/ or other higher vesion to do this logic. So we try to using
8085. After I searched all the asm commands, I did not find any resource about deletion.
Then JPSir came and asked, how does computer deletion? I got results, using n's complement 
and implement and added 1, if got carry, then did a complement and added 1 again. Then
he got an smell, 8086's deletion was truly promoted with this method. After this session,
I strongly knowing that science was an evolutional inheritance. For everything we know
how to use it, and we also need to know how to made it.

The second story
This was a computer IC class and we needed to do a runtime design of CPU, to make a 
calculation of each ASM command processing, we also need to draw the state graph. When
I finished the question, I saw him towerd with me and looked carefully with my graph, 
after a while and asked me where did the clock comments? I said at the left parts, he 
angried with me and said: why you write at the left part? all the book, all the resource
was for the right. Suddenly I knew my mistake, and speedly changed to the right side.
After this session, I strongly knowing that science was a rigorous and an accuration, 
everything we know how to use it, but we could not to make change of it.
